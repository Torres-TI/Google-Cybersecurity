<h2>Play it Safe: Manage Security Risks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Frameworks</li>
  <li>Controls</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Security Frameworks</b> are guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, such as engineering attacks and ransomware. Implementing these plans and educating employees is crucial for keeping your organization safe.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Controls</b> are used to reduce specific risks. Encryption, authentication, and authorization are the three common types of controls.
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Example: plain text to ciphertext.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Authentication</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The process of verifying who someone or something is. Example: Username and password.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Authorization</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Tip: Controls are a core element of the CIA Triad.<br>
  Tip: CTF means Cyber Threat Framework :)
</p>

<p>
  <b>CIA Triad</b> is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
  <span>Tip: CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Confidentiality</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Integrity</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The data is correct, authentic, and reliable.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Availability</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><b>NIST Cybersecurity Framework CSF</b> is a open source framework organized by five keys indentify, protect, detect, respond and recover.</p>
<p><b>Playbooks</b> are manuals to ensure the people will folllow the right list of actions, it's like a checklist.
 <b>Incident Response Playboo</b><br> it's the most common palybook guide in cybersecurity, that playbook is separeted in 6 phases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preparation</li>
  <li>Detection and analysis</li>
  <li>Containement</li>
  <li>Eradication and recovery</li>
  <li>Post-incident activity</li>
  <li>Coordination</li>
</ul>
